### Project Description
"WoW" is an app designed to help working women organize their lives and track their mood levels and their work-life time allocations. It offers mood tracking with insights into emotional well-being, including a stress prediction feature powered by a machine learning model. 

### The Problem statement
Many working women, especially those juggling 9-to-5 jobs, find themselves caught in the chaos of work deadlines, family time, and personal care. Balancing everything can feel like walking a tightrope, leaving little room to check in on their mental health or stay on top of their well-being. There's a need for a fun, easy-to-use tool that helps them track their moods, manage their schedules, and maintain a healthy balance between work and life‚Äîwithout adding to the stress!

### The Solution
"WoW" is your new best friend in managing work-life balance and tracking your mood! With fun emoticons on a calendar, you can easily track your mood every day‚Äîwhether you're feeling happy, stressed, or somewhere in between. Plus, the app gives you monthly mood insights to help you understand your emotional ups and downs. The Time tracking feature helps you see where your hours go, and maybe even discover you‚Äôre spending more time on your overtime paychecks than you thought!. The stress prediction feature uses a machine learning model to analyze data from your smartwatch (like steps, sleep, and even blood pressure!) to help you stay ahead of stress. The app's landing page guides you to sign up and get started with just your email and a secure password!
